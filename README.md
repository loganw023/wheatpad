# wheatpad
This is a macropad for personal use. It has six keys, a rotary encoder with a switch, and an OLED screen. I used KMK firmware to code the macropad. I used the macropad as an introduction to PCB design and to increasea my CAD experience. 

## CAD
I used Fusion360 to create my macropad case. There are two parts: a bottom and a top.
